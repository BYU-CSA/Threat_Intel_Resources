# BYU World Factbook

This project is a web application that allows users to view and edit Cybersecurity information about countries. We patterned it after the CIA World Factbook, and it has more of a focus on Cybersecurity than the CIA Factbook.

In order to see what the application looks like, make sure upon cloning the repository that you run `npm install` and `npm start` in the root directory. This will install all the dependencies and start the application on localhost:3000.
